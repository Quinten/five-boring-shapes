# Five Boring Shapes

Slow one-screen match game

Tap on shapes that have matching neighbours to remove them and score points.

White shapes restock when there are no more matching white shapes.

Leftovers will turn blue and can be matched later with other blue shapes.

When there are no more matching blue shapes and you have a stacked a column with all blue shapes, it's game over.

Board state is saved when you close the game and restored when you come back. So you can play long games in short chunks.
